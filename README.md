# GTA_V_Session_Sniffer-plugin-2Take1-Lua

### Allows you to have every usernames showing up on [GTA V Session Sniffer](https://github.com/Illegal-Services/GTA-V-Session-Sniffer) project, by logging all players from your sessions to `scripts/GTA_V_Session_Sniffer-plugin/log.txt`.<br>

#### Additionally, there's a feature that if you encounter a user flagged as a [Fake Friend](https://gta.2take1.menu/features/online/fake-friends/) with ["Join Timeout"](https://gta.2take1.menu/features/online/join/#join-timeout) flag, it automatically ["Bail/Netsplit"](https://gta.2take1.menu/features/online/lobby/#bail-netsplit) you from the session.<br>
